#### While creating the schema tables into trouble with primary and foreiegn keys and how they relate. Was able to trouble shoot through youtube and previous classes.

#### Gained a firm understanding of aliases and how they work during this assignment. They are quite useful and can make things alot more concise and simpler when writing queries. 

#### Creating tables was also a bit of a hassle and the data engineering and modeling part of the project took by far the longest and once that was done running the queries was rather easy and straight forward.
